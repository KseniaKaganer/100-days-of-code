# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Ksenia

### Day 1: June 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Setup TensorFlow library for .NET (TensorFlowSharp) to combine with Unity ML-Agents and started to work on the "3D Balance Ball" Environment.

**Thoughts:** New subject.... took me some time to get into it, hopefully tomorrow will do more progress ^_^

### 

### Day 2: June 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Trained my first baby Agent to correctly balance a ball, using Reinforcement Learning algorithm called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

**Thoughts:** Feeling good to see some results, but I think tomorrow I should try to dive to some deeper understanding :)

### Day 3: June 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Made my SocerAcademy example with "GoalieBrain" and "StrikerBrain" also learned a little bit more about Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

**Thoughts:** Lot's of new information... didn't feel that I made lot's of progress today.

### Day 5: June 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continue working on the **StarCraft** game. More focusing on the building logic

**Thoughts:** Long work day... It's hard to code all day at work and then find time to advance myself everyday in my free time.
But I'll continue trying.

### Day 6: June 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started to do something I always wanted to - Useful standalone code packages. so I created a "TemplateProject" for this purpose and started coding it, with potential of maximized abstraction.
For now added FileReader, XmlReader and EditorMenuItem.

**Thoughts:** Almost had no time to do the challenge but then delayed my sleep... and survived one more day :D

### Day 7: June 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continue adding/editing my ultimate "TemplateProject".
Was a little lazy but I need to made myself write some tests to make it much more useful... Hopefully when I'm done I'll upload it to Github so maybe more people will find it useful.

**Thoughts:** Work Hard Go Pro! :)

**Today's Progress:** Continue adding/editing my ultimate "TemplateProject".
Finally I encourage myself to work on a good 'Test Runner' for my project.

**Thoughts:** Tired from a long work day... Hopefully more progress tomorrow!
