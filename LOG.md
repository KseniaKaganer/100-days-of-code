# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Ksenia

### Day 1: June 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Setup TensorFlow library for .NET (TensorFlowSharp) to combine with Unity ML-Agents and started to work on the "3D Balance Ball" Environment.

**Thoughts:** New subject.... took me some time to get into it, hopefully tomorrow will do more progress ^_^

### Day 2: June 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Trained my first baby Agent to correctly balance a ball, using Reinforcement Learning algorithm called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

**Thoughts:** Feeling good to see some results, but I think tomorrow I should try to dive to some deeper understanding :)
